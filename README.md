Name: CyLearn


Purpose: To allow students and teachers to have a single platform to share ideas and be able to manage all the things required in a college setting.

Description of the project:

i) The problem: Students in college and the higher authorities such as the TA’s and the teachers, have to use multiple applications to be able to access their schedules, conduct meetings, have study sessions, and so on, such as using google docs for sharing notes, webex/zoom for conducting meetings and visual rooms for study sessions. This takes up a lot of time and makes it difficult for students to manage multiple applications all at once.

ii) Project Mechanism: Our project will combine the functionalities of many applications to allow students to do most of their work in one application. A chat function and schedule maker will allow students to plan their day, and make scheduling meetings with their group easier. Professors and TA’s will be able to assign documents and view submissions. Students can store their notes for classes, and share them with other students.

Language: Java / SQL

Platform: Android Studio

Frameworks: SpringBoot, Maven

Complexity:

-Having multiple screens such as the login page, home page displaying the various tasks the user can do, and then multiple screens based on the task selected by the user. Complexity of the screen will be based on the functionality of the specific task. -Using libraries and platforms that haven’t been previously used by team members in order to work on the functionality of the project. -Accessing multiple databases and apis in order to allow the user to perform tasks such as accessing their calendar, the chat rooms, their notes and other such tasks. -This application is going to be a real time and a peer-peer based application, as all the users will have the access to use the application anytime they want, and will be using tasks such as the chat room, study sessions and so on in real time. -Every individual screen will have its own database in order to allow the users to add or retrieve things as per their preference.
